# ITAviewer
Javascript library to load and display channels of ToF-SIMS ITA files from iontof.

You can test this library online: http://scholi.github.io/ITAviewer
It works 100% offline, so you can also download it.

It is still in beta and was not tested extensively with many data, so it might not work yet as expected. Please [report issues here](https://github.com/scholi/ITAviewer/issues).

## How it works
1. Load an ITA file by clicking the "Choose file" button.
2. Select your channel
3. Select the colormap you want to use.
4. The image of the selected channel will then be displayed in your browser
5. You can perform a right-click "Save image as..."  on the image in order to export it.
